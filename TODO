** verbs don't emit adverbial particibles
** nouns don't emit vocative case
** html output is not standard-conforming
   and in fact is completely broken, with multiple <html> and possibly
   multiple </html>
** noun gender may most likely differ per form
   e.g. александр gives александр, александрович and александровна.
   путин gives both путин and путина.  It's hard to imagine that the
   gender doesn't change here per-form.
