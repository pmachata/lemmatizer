** DONE html output is not standard-conforming

   and in fact is completely broken, with multiple <html> and possibly
   multiple </html>
** noun gender may most likely differ per form
   e.g. александр gives александр, александрович and александровна.
   путин gives both путин and путина.  It's hard to imagine that the
   gender doesn't change here per-form.
** rendering of numbers is not optimal
   right now small numbers work nice, they have all the forms
   correctly tabulatized.  For higher numbers, like 5, where genders
   are not mentioned, the system assumes they are plural, and renders
   the table nonsensically.  Really we would like to render gendered
   numbers differently from those that have no gender.
